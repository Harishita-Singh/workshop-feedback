First of all,Thank You from the bottom of my heart Respected Atul Sir!

I`m Harshita B.tech 1st year from CSE(IOT) department and I would like to thank you for such
a wonderful python workshop session it was, let me say this is one of the most 
wonderful session I have attended. It`s my first time that I learn python And 
it`s difficult for me as I don`t even know basics but Thanks to Atul Sir, for
giving me the knowledge of Python and GitHub also. We all know python is not that 
easy which can be learned in only 10 days, But now i know the bascis & know how to 
learn learn any programming language not only python. Sir your teaching in a 
very excellent way...Not only teaching, you motivates and inspires each and 
individual student i all aspects always with smiling face ....
